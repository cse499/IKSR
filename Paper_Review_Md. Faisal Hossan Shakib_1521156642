1. Information Propagation in the Bitcoin Network:

In this paper they studied how Bitcoin utilizes a multi-bounce communicate to spread exchanges and blocks through the system to update 
the record copies. Then they utilize the assembled data to check the idea that the engendering delay in the system is the essential 
reason for blockchain forks. They suggested that Blockchain forks ought to be kept away from as they are symptomatic for irregularities 
among the imitations in the network. They tried to break down the synchronization component which neglects to synchronize the data put 
away at the record with a non-immaterial property. They also proposed a few changes to the present convention that, while not an answer 
for the inherent issues of the correspondence model utilized by Bitcoin, may alleviate them. And they presented a model that clarifies 
the presence of blockchain forks, and certify the model by coordinating it to their observations. They made some changes in the networks
and their estimations showed that a single node actualizing these progressions decreases the quantity of blockchain forks in the system 
by over 50%.

2. Permacoin: Repurposing Bitcoin Work for Data Preservation:

Here they propose an adjustment to Bitcoin that repurposes its mining assets to accomplish an all the more comprehensively helpful
objective. Here they named their new scheme as permacoin, a modification to bitcoin. They allude to the essential unit of mining work in 
Bitcoin as a scratch-off puzzle (SOP). At the time of composing, mining a Bitcoin block (bunch of coins) requires around 255 hash 
calculations and the Bitcoin network mines a block generally every ten minutes, and subsequently devours huge computing assets and 
natural assets, for example, power, inciting boundless worry about waste. Their approach has been to supplant the fundamental 
computational SOP in Bitcoin with one dependent on Proofs-of-Retrievability. Given the size of the current Bitcoin organize, they 
assume that their plan would reuse enough assets to store at any rate a "Library of Congress" worth of information (i.e., 200 terabytes)
in an globally circulated system.


3. Primecoin: Cryptocurrency with Prime Number Proof-of-Work:

This paper studied about a sort of proof of-work dependent on scanning for prime numbers is presented in shared cryptocurrency plans. 
Prime chain is connected to block hash to safeguard the security property of Nakamoto's Bitcoin, while a persistent trouble assessment 
conspire is intended to enable prime chain to work as adjustable trouble proof of-work in a Bitcoin like cryptographic money. The 
authors of this paper proposed a design of an authentic prime number based proof of work  giving both printing and security to 
cryptographic money systems like hashcash sort of proof of-work and they named it primecoin. This paper is intended to make ready for 
other proof-of-work types with different logical processing esteems to rise.


4. Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph:

In this paper they discussed the answer for an assortment of inquiries regarding the conduct of the clients, how they get and how they 
spend their bitcoins, the equalization of bitcoins they keep in their records, and how they move bitcoins between their different 
records apropos to more likely secure their privacy. The authors tried to answer some precise questions like what number of various 
clients are there in the system? What number of bitcoins are commonly kept in each record, and how does this equalization shift after 
some time? Are most bitcoins kept by a couple of enormous clients? Do they keep their bitcoins in saving accounts" or do they spend 
them right away? What number of clients had enormous adjusts sooner or later in time? What is the size circulation of bitcoin exchanges,
and what number of them are micropayments? They noticed that the subgraph which contains the huge exchanges alongside their neighborhood
has numerous peculiar looking structures which could be an endeavor to disguise the presence and connection between these exchanges, 
yet such an endeavor can be thwarted by following the cash trail in a sufficiently diligent manner.


5. Nonoutsourceable Scratch-Off Puzzles to Discourage Bitcoin Mining Coalitions: 

The aim of this paper is to understand the diffuse system of Bitcoin's prize structure and its impact over a different, decentralized
populace of individual members. They discussed that the amplitude of mining coalition is because of a restriction of the Bitcoin proof 
of-work perplex – explicitly, that it bears a powerful system for authorizing participation in an alliance. They presented a few 
definitions and developments for "nonoutsourceable" puzzles that defeat such implementation components, along these lines dissuading 
alliances. To guarantee security the most central suspicion made by decentralized cryptographic forms of money is that no single 
substance or administration employs an enormous part of the computational assets in the system. Breaking this assumption can be cause 
for a massive problem in the security properties of this network. They have contributed two developments: a feeble nonoutsourceable 
puzzle provable in the irregular oracle model, and a nonexclusive change from any powerless nonoutsourceable puzzle to a solid one. 
They suggest that this could be utilized to ensure that participation as a free individual is the best mining procedure.


6.	Tendermint: Consensus without Mining:

This paper proposed an answer for the blockchain agreement issue that doesn't require mining by adjusting a current answer for the
Byzantine Generals Problem. The goal of cryptocurrency conventions, for example, Bitcoin is to keep up a live decentralized exchange
record while guarding against double spend attacks from vindictive Byzantine actors that go astray from the convention. Consensus of 
the Bitcoin exchange record is verified by a system of miners who vie for remunerations in the blockchain. The author’s commitment here
is a novel consensus convention that requires no proof of-work mining and has a significant level of security against double spend 
attacks. And they made a weak presumption about the member's abilities to keep time, and they assume incomplete synchrony of the
system.

7.	Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin: 

While Bitcoin offers the potential for new sorts of budgetary association, it has huge impediments with respect to privacy. In this 
paper they propose Zerocoin, a cryptographic augmentation to Bitcoin that increases the convention to take into account completely 
mysterious money exchanges and their system uses standard cryptographic assumption and does not bring in new parties or change the 
security model. In this paper they portray Zerocoin, a circulated e-money system that utilizations cryptographic methods to break the 
connection between individual Bitcoin exchanges without including confided in parties. They conclude that their works has a several 
open problem and further research on their works could prompt various tradeoffs between security, responsibility, and anonymity.


8.	Towards Risk Scoring of Bitcoin Transactions:

This paper says that if Bitcoin turns into the common installment system on the Internet, wrongdoing warriors will unite with 
controllers and uphold boycotting of exchange prefixes at the gatherings who offer genuine items and administrations in return for 
bitcoin. Here the authors designed a risk model on basis of prediction using public knowledge and data and also discussed the 
implications as a unit of account in the market.  The ubiquity of Bitcoin among crooks, supposedly for its anonymity and free to 
missing guideline, has called for new ways to deal with battling money related crime submitted in or settled through Bitcoin. They 
proposed a promising technique that is to blacklist exchange prefixes to refute resources beginning from criminal continues. This paper
considers the future of Bitcoin where boycotting of realized awful exchange prefixes is regular practice and the subsequent boycotts 
are seen by every pertinent parties where bitcoins can be spent.
