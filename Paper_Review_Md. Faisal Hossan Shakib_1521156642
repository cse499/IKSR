1. Information Propagation in the Bitcoin Network:

In this paper they studied how Bitcoin utilizes a multi-bounce communicate to spread exchanges and blocks through the system to update the
record copies. Then they utilize the assembled data to check the idea that the engendering delay in the system is the essential reason for
blockchain forks. They suggested that Blockchain forks ought to be kept away from as they are symptomatic for irregularities among the
imitations in the network. They tried to break down the synchronization component which neglects to synchronize the data put away at the
record with a non-immaterial property. They also proposed a few changes to the present convention that, while not an answer for the
inherent issues of the correspondence model utilized by Bitcoin, may alleviate them. And they presented a model that clarifies the presence
of blockchain forks, and certify the model by coordinating it to their observations. They made some changes in the networks and their 
estimations showed that a single node actualizing these progressions decreases the quantity of blockchain forks in the system by over 50%.

2. Permacoin: Repurposing Bitcoin Work for Data Preservation:

Here they propose an adjustment to Bitcoin that repurposes its mining assets to accomplish an all the more comprehensively helpful
objective. Here they named their new scheme as permacoin, a modification to bitcoin. They allude to the essential unit of mining work in 
Bitcoin as a scratch-off puzzle (SOP). At the time of composing, mining a Bitcoin block (bunch of coins) requires around 255 hash 
calculations and the Bitcoin network mines a block generally every ten minutes, and subsequently devours huge computing assets and natural
assets, for example, power, inciting boundless worry about waste. Their approach has been to supplant the fundamental computational SOP in
Bitcoin with one dependent on Proofs-of-Retrievability. Given the size of the current Bitcoin organize, they assume that their plan would
reuse enough assets to store at any rate a "Library of Congress" worth of information (i.e., 200 terabytes) in an globally circulated 
system.


3. Primecoin: Cryptocurrency with Prime Number Proof-of-Work:

This paper studied about a sort of proof of-work dependent on scanning for prime numbers is presented in shared cryptocurrency plans. 
Prime chain is connected to block hash to safeguard the security property of Nakamoto's Bitcoin, while a persistent trouble assessment 
conspire is intended to enable prime chain to work as adjustable trouble proof of-work in a Bitcoin like cryptographic money. The authors 
of this paper proposed a design of an authentic prime number based proof of work  giving both printing and security to cryptographic money
systems like hashcash sort of proof of-work and they named it primecoin. This paper is intended to make ready for other proof-of-work types
with different logical processing esteems to rise.


4. Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph:

In this paper they discussed the answer for an assortment of inquiries regarding the conduct of the clients, how they get and how they 
spend their bitcoins, the equalization of bitcoins they keep in their records, and how they move bitcoins between their different records
apropos to more likely secure their privacy. The authors tried to answer some precise questions like what number of various clients are 
there in the system? What number of bitcoins are commonly kept in each record, and how does this equalization shift after some time? Are
most bitcoins kept by a couple of enormous clients? Do they keep their bitcoins in saving accounts" or do they spend them right away?
What number of clients had enormous adjusts sooner or later in time? What is the size circulation of bitcoin exchanges, and what number
of them are micropayments? They noticed that the subgraph which contains the huge exchanges alongside their neighborhood has numerous
peculiar looking structures which could be an endeavor to disguise the presence and connection between these exchanges, yet such an 
endeavor can be thwarted by following the cash trail in a sufficiently diligent manner.


5.	Nonoutsourceable Scratch-Off Puzzles to Discourage Bitcoin Mining Coalitions: 

The aim of this paper is to understand the diffuse system of Bitcoin's prize structure and its impact over a different, decentralized
populace of individual members. They discussed that the amplitude of mining coalition is because of a restriction of the Bitcoin proof 
of-work perplex â€“ explicitly, that it bears a powerful system for authorizing participation in an alliance. They presented a few 
definitions and developments for "nonoutsourceable" puzzles that defeat such implementation components, along these lines dissuading 
alliances. To guarantee security the most central suspicion made by decentralized cryptographic forms of money is that no single 
substance or administration employs an enormous part of the computational assets in the system. Breaking this assumption can be cause 
for a massive problem in the security properties of this network. They have contributed two developments: a feeble nonoutsourceable 
puzzle provable in the irregular oracle model, and a nonexclusive change from any powerless nonoutsourceable puzzle to a solid one. 
They suggest that this could be utilized to ensure that participation as a free individual is the best mining procedure.
